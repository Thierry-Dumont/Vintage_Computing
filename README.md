# Vintage_Computing

Make some old numerical progams (mainly in Algol) run again.

This directory will be populated with wonderfull programs, as soon as possible.
Nowadays, you can just play with **Bairstow/**, an Algol 60 implementation of
Bairstow's method ,to compute roots of (real) polynomials.


### You need to install two compilers:

* **jff-algol** from [Github](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler),

* **GNU marst** from [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/marst/).

Both are very easy to install on any Linux machine.


## Some comments and material will be posted here, soon.
