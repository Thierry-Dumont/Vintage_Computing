## Material, and how to use it:


* **bair.alg** is the program.

### To compile and run the code:

* you can try both compilers: **jff-algol** and **marst**.

* There are 2 sripts for this: **jff** and **marst-it**.


Both scripts translate **bair.alg** to C, and then compile the result.

The executable is **bair** , in both cases.

### Verify results with SageMath:

* Edit *certify.sage* so that _pol_ contains the same data as _pol_ in _bair.alg_

* Just type:  **sage certify.sage**
