This example comes from the book _Procédures Algol en Analyse Numérique_
(_Algol  procedures for Numerical Analysis_). It results from a collective work
initiated by the French CNRS and was published in 1970. Routines should have
been written some years before.

* **Original/** contains the material from the book (scaned pages), the program
  extracted from the book and scripts to compile it.

* **Julia/** Bairstow's method in julia.

* **Rewritten/** Bairstow's method in Algol 60, rewritten. It is very near from
 the julia version, with only one _goto_, and better structured.
 
 _This shows, to my own opinion, the beauty of Algol 60!_

* **Doc/** a description of Bairstow's method.
