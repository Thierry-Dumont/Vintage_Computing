This example comes from the book _Procédures Algol en Analyse Numérique_
(_Algol  procedures for Numerical Analysis_). It results from a collective work
initiated by the French CNRS and was published in 1970. Routines should have
been written some years before.

* Original/ contains the material from the book (scaned pages), the program
  extracted from the book and scripts to run it.

* Julia/ Bairstow's method in julia.

* Rewritten/ Bairstow's method in Algol 60, rewritten. It is very near from
 the julia version, with much less gotos, and better structured.

* Doc/ some documentation on Bairstow's method.
